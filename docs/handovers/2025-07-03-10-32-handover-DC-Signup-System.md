## Project Status
The admin UI now supports:
* Member list rendering
* Offline cache via IndexedDB (first fetch cached, offline banner shown)
* Bulk select & bulk delete with unified confirmation modal
* Service-worker offline support already in place for core app

Outstanding blockers discovered during automated testing:
* Hidden modal overlay intercepts clicks, blocking login.
* Playwright automated test not yet completed (login blocked).
* Server-side security for delete still pending (needs service_role or edge function).

## Key Decisions (this session)
1. Added IndexedDB cache & bulk delete directly in `admin.html`.
2. Switched `admin.html` to use `__SUPABASE_URL__`/`__SUPABASE_ANON_KEY__` placeholders; `build.sh` now injects env vars into admin page.
3. Confirmed build pipeline injects variables when env vars are exported at build time.

## Priority Next Steps
1. **Fix modal overlay pointer-events** so hidden modal never blocks UI.
2. Rebuild `dist/` & restart local server.
3. Finish Playwright test:
   * Login with valid credentials.
   * Verify member list loads.
   * Exercise single delete & bulk delete.
   * Simulate offline (block network) and confirm cached list loads.
4. Update docs & CHANGELOG after successful test.
5. Implement server-side security for deletes (service_role key or edge function).
6. Document required environment variables in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
7. Run full deployment checklist.

## Critical Technical Notes
* Build script now handles `dist/admin.html` injections via `sed`.
* Static server runs on port 4173: `python3 -m http.server 4173 -d dist/`.
* Playwright MCP session already started; resume after modal overlay fix.
* Use CSS rule `.modal-overlay.hidden{display:none!important;pointer-events:none!important;}`.
