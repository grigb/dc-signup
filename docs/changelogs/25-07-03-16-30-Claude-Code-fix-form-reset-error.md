## Time Tracking
**Initial Estimate**: 30 minutes
**Start Time**: 16:30
**End Time**: 16:45  
**Actual Time**: 15 minutes
**Estimate Accuracy**: 200% (15 minutes under)

### Time Breakdown
- Research & debugging: 8 minutes
- Implementation: 2 minutes  
- Testing: 4 minutes
- Documentation: 1 minute

### Time Impact Factors
- [-10 min] Simple fix - just reordering function calls
- [-5 min] Clear error message made debugging straightforward

## Summary
Fixed a JavaScript error that occurred when submitting the signup form. The error "Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')" was caused by attempting to reset form elements before the form page was displayed.

## Files Modified
- `src/index.html` - Reordered function calls in submitConfirmedData()

## Changes Made
- Moved `showFormStep()` before `resetForm()` in the submitConfirmedData function
- This ensures the form page is displayed (and all form elements exist) before attempting to reset them
- The fix prevents the null reference error when renderCreatorTypes() tries to update the creatorTypeList element

## Testing
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] Form submission works without errors
- [x] Form resets properly after submission
- [x] Success message displays correctly

## Historical Learning
**Similar Tasks**: First form submission error fix for this project
**Average Time**: N/A (first instance)
**Common Blockers**: DOM element availability timing issues
**Recommendations**: Always ensure DOM elements exist before manipulating them

## Notes
The error was happening because:
1. After form submission, the code showed a review page
2. resetForm() was called while still on the review page
3. renderCreatorTypes() tried to access creatorTypeList which didn't exist on the review page
4. Moving showFormStep() first ensures we're back on the form page before resetting
