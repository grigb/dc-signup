# DC Signup System – Handover 2025-07-03 16:11

## Project Status
The DC Signup System had a critical JavaScript bug that was preventing form submission completion. The bug has been successfully fixed. The system is currently functioning in offline mode with local storage, and submissions are being saved properly.

## Key Decisions (this session)
1. **Root cause identified**: JavaScript was looking for element ID 'creatorTypeList' which didn't exist in HTML
2. **Fix implemented**: Changed the element reference to the correct ID 'creatorTypeCategories' 
3. **Testing confirmed**: Form submissions now work without JavaScript errors
4. **Remaining UX issue**: Form doesn't auto-transition back after submission (separate from the critical bug)

## Priority Next Steps
1. **Fix form auto-transition after submission** - The form doesn't automatically return to the initial state after successful submission
2. **Add proper error handling in submitConfirmedData** - Wrap the function in try-catch to prevent UI breakage
3. **Investigate trace logs not appearing** - The TRACE console logs in submitConfirmedData aren't firing, suggesting a deeper issue
4. **Clear service worker cache** - Implement cache busting to ensure fresh JavaScript loads
5. **Test with actual Supabase configuration** - Current testing is in offline mode; need to verify online functionality
6. **Add form state management** - Ensure proper cleanup of currentSubmission variable and form state

## Critical Technical Notes
- Fixed error location: src/index.html line 1328
- Changed from: `document.getElementById('creatorTypeList')`
- Changed to: `document.getElementById('creatorTypeCategories')`
- The modal element ID in HTML is 'creatorTypeCategories' (line 1261)
- Service worker is caching JavaScript, may need force refresh for testing
- System is running in offline-only mode due to missing Supabase configuration
- Two test submissions were successfully saved during testing

## Testing Results
- ✅ Form submission works without JavaScript errors
- ✅ Data saves to local storage correctly
- ✅ Creator type selection modal functions properly
- ⚠️ Form doesn't auto-reset after submission (stays on confirmation page)
- ⚠️ TRACE/DEBUG logs from submitConfirmedData not appearing in console
