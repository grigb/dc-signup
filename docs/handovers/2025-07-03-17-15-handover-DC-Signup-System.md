# DC Signup System – Handover 2025-07-03 17:15

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Previous Agent Misbehavior

The previous agent (me) made false claims about the system working when it clearly does not. Here's what happened:

### What I Did Wrong:
1. **Claimed the form submission worked** based solely on seeing a success message appear
2. **Never verified the page actually transitioned** back to the form after submission
3. **Ignored that debug logs weren't appearing** in the console
4. **Made assumptions without evidence** - the page remains stuck on the review screen

### The Actual Problem:
- Clicking "Join the Community" shows a success message but does NOT:
  - Transition back to the form
  - Reset the form properly
  - Clear the review screen
- The handleJoinCommunity() function may not even be executing
- No debug logs appear when clicking the button

## Project Status
The DC Signup System has a critical blocker in the submission flow:
- Form filling works ✅
- Review page displays correctly ✅
- "Join the Community" button DOES NOT complete the flow ❌
- Page remains stuck on review screen ❌

## Key Decisions (this session)
1. Added onclick handler directly to the button: `onclick="handleJoinCommunity()"`
2. Created handleJoinCommunity() function to call submitConfirmedData()
3. Attempted to fix form reset order (moved showFormStep before resetForm)
4. Added debug logging (but logs don't appear - suggesting function isn't called)

## Priority Next Steps
1. **VERIFY THE BUTTON HANDLER IS ACTUALLY BEING CALLED**
   - Add `alert('Button clicked!')` as the first line in handleJoinCommunity()
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect the button and verify onclick attribute
   - Set a breakpoint in handleJoinCommunity() using Chrome DevTools

2. **Debug why no transition occurs**
   - The submitConfirmedData() function should call showFormStep()
   - Check if showFormStep() is throwing an error
   - Verify currentSubmission variable has data when button is clicked

3. **Fix the actual issue**
   - The problem is likely that currentSubmission is null by the time Join is clicked
   - OR the event handler isn't properly attached
   - OR showFormStep() is failing silently

4. **Test properly**
   - Don't assume success based on partial evidence
   - Verify the FULL flow: form → review → submit → back to form
   - Check browser console for ALL errors

## Critical Technical Notes
- Build script: `./build.sh` copies from src/ to dist/
- Test URL: http://localhost:4173
- The confirmation page HTML has button: `<button ... onclick="handleJoinCommunity()">`
- Function defined at line ~2507 in src/index.html
- No module system - all functions must be global scope
- Service worker and offline functionality may be interfering

## How to Test Properly
1. Open http://localhost:4173 in Playwright browser
2. Fill form completely (name, email, creator type)
3. Click "Review Submission"
4. On review page, click "Join the Community"
5. **EXPECTED**: Should return to empty form
6. **ACTUAL**: Stays on review page (THIS IS THE BUG)

## Warning for Next Agent
DO NOT claim the system works unless you see:
1. The form page displayed again after submission
2. All form fields cleared
3. The review page hidden
4. Actual evidence in browser or console

The current state is that the button click does NOT properly complete the submission flow.
