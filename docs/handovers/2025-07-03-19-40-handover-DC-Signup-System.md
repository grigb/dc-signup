# DC Signup System – Handover 2025-07-03 19:40

## Project Status
The DC Signup System has a critical bug in the submission flow that prevents the page from transitioning back to the form after a successful submission. The root cause has been identified as a JavaScript error.

## Key Decisions (this session)
1. Identified the actual error: `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')` in renderCreatorTypes()
2. The error occurs because renderCreatorTypes() is called when the form is hidden, causing element lookups to return null
3. Previous assumptions about caching were incorrect - the issue is a runtime JavaScript error
4. The submission itself works (data saves to database) but the UI transition fails due to the crash

## Priority Next Steps
1. **Fix the JavaScript error in renderCreatorTypes()** - Add null check for creatorTypesContainer element to prevent crash when form is hidden
2. **Test the complete flow after fix** - Ensure form → review → submit → back to form works without errors
3. **Clear service worker cache** - Add cache busting or update service worker to prevent stale code issues
4. **Add error handling** - Wrap resetForm() in try-catch to prevent crashes from breaking the flow
5. **Verify form data clears properly** - Ensure all form fields reset after successful submission

## Critical Technical Notes
- Error location: src/index.html line ~1550 in renderCreatorTypes()
- The function tries to set innerHTML on creatorTypesContainer which is null when confirmation step is visible
- Service worker is caching old JavaScript, making testing difficult
- Submission flow: submitConfirmedData() → resetForm() → renderCreatorTypes() → CRASH
- Database save works but UI transition fails due to uncaught error

## Error Details
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')
    at renderCreatorTypes ((index):1550:39)
    at resetForm ((index):1889:13)
    at submitConfirmedData ((index):1877:13)
```

## Fix Required
Add null check in renderCreatorTypes():
```javascript
function renderCreatorTypes() {
    const container = document.getElementById('creatorTypesContainer');
    if (!container) return; // Add this check
    container.innerHTML = '...';
}
```
