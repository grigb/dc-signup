# DC Signup System Handover - 2025-06-30-19-15

## Project Status: CRITICAL - BLANK PAGE ISSUE

**URGENT**: Application is currently showing blank page despite recent fixes. Server/permissions issues preventing testing. Conference deployment tonight requires immediate resolution.

## Key Decisions From This Session

### âœ… COMPLETED: Major Layout Fixes Applied
1. **Confirmation Step Fixed**: Applied width constraint (500px max), proper modal layout, form data preservation
2. **Offline Viewer Fixed**: Applied identical layout pattern to fix button visibility and scrolling
3. **API Error Handling**: Added graceful offline fallback for missing/invalid API keys
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Added iPad/mobile media queries for conference booth use

### ðŸš¨ CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE
- **Blank Page**: Application not loading despite successful code changes
- **Server Problems**: HTTP server commands failing with permissions errors
- **Working Directory**: May need to change working directory for proper access
- **Testing Blocked**: Cannot verify fixes due to inability to load application

## Priority Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE (Must Fix Now):
1. **Resolve blank page issue** - Investigate why application won't load
2. **Fix working directory/permissions** - Ensure proper file access
3. **Start HTTP server successfully** - Get application running for testing
4. **Autonomous Playwright testing** - Test all functionality until working

### VERIFICATION NEEDED:
1. **Confirmation step**: Width constraint, form data preservation, Edit Details button
2. **Offline viewer**: Layout, scrolling, button visibility at bottom
3. **Complete form flow**: Fill â†’ Review â†’ Edit â†’ Submit
4. **iPad responsiveness**: Touch interface for conference booth
5. **API error handling**: Graceful offline mode when API unavailable

## Critical Technical Notes

### Files Modified:
- **Main File**: `/Users/grig/work/distributed-creatives/dc-websites/dc-signup-system/index.html`
- **Documentation**: Added multiple fix plan documents

### Key Code Changes Applied:
- **Confirmation Step CSS** (lines ~651-811): Fixed positioning, 500px width constraint, modal layout
- **Offline Viewer CSS** (lines ~814-915): Identical pattern applied for consistency  
- **HTML Structure**: Added `.confirmation-container` and `.offline-container` wrappers
- **JavaScript**: Added missing `restoreFormData()` function (lines ~2070-2128)
- **Responsive**: Mobile/iPad media queries for both confirmation and offline viewer

### Working Directory Issues:
- **Current Issue**: Commands failing due to directory restrictions
- **Correct Project Path**: `/Users/grig/work/distributed-creatives/dc-websites/dc-signup-system/`
- **Git Repository**: Changes may need to be committed from correct directory

## Conference Deployment Status

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Cannot currently test fixes due to blank page
**Timeline**: Tonight's deployment at risk
**Required**: Immediate resolution of loading issues and autonomous testing until working

## Success Criteria for Next Session

âœ… **Page loads successfully**
âœ… **Confirmation step works**: Proper width, button visibility, form preservation
âœ… **Offline viewer works**: Scrolling, fixed buttons, proper layout  
âœ… **No JavaScript errors** in console
âœ… **Mobile/iPad responsive** for conference booth
âœ… **Complete workflow functional**: Form â†’ Review â†’ Edit â†’ Submit

## Autonomous Testing Required

Next AI session must:
1. Get application loading properly
2. Run Playwright tests autonomously
3. Fix any discovered issues immediately
4. Iterate until all functionality verified working
5. Prepare for conference deployment tonight
