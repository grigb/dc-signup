# DC Signup System Handover - 2025-06-30-21-45

## Project Status: READY FOR FINAL FIX & DEPLOYMENT

**URGENT**: Conference deployment needed in 1-2 hours. Application is functional except for one critical button.

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working:
- Main application loads and functions properly
- Form submission flow works
- Confirmation step displays correctly
- Email verification system implemented (AWS SES configured)
- Admin panel exists with delete functionality
- Build process ready with new API keys
- Offline functionality operational

### ❌ Critical Issue:
- **Edit Details button does not work** - Users cannot return from confirmation to form
- Button exists but onclick handler not firing
- Function `handleEditDetails` is defined but needs window binding

## Key Decisions From This Session

1. **Diagnosed Edit Details Issue**: Function exists but not properly exposed for inline onclick
2. **Confirmed Application State**: No blank page issue - app loads normally
3. **Email System Ready**: AWS SES configured, database functions updated
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Use existing Cloudflare Pages auto-deployment

## Priority Next Steps

### 1. FIX EDIT DETAILS BUTTON (5 minutes)
In `src/index.html` after line 2464, add:
```javascript
// Ensure function is accessible from onclick handlers
window.handleEditDetails = handleEditDetails;
```

### 2. UPDATE GENESIS MEMBERS TEXT (3 minutes)
Change: "Include me in the 'Genesis Members' showcase"
To: "Include me as a founding member of Distributed Creatives"

### 3. CLEAN UP TEST FILES (2 minutes)
Delete:
- test-edit-button.js
- test-edit-button-v2.js
- test-edit-final.js
- test-button-diagnostic.js

### 4. BUILD & DEPLOY (15 minutes)
```bash
# Load environment variables
export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)

# Build
./build.sh

# Copy to deployment
cp -r dist/* cloudflare-deploy/

# Commit and deploy
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix Edit Details button for conference deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Critical Technical Notes

### Edit Details Fix Location:
- File: `/Users/grig/work/distributed-creatives/dc-websites/dc-signup-system/src/index.html`
- Line: After 2464 (end of handleEditDetails function)
- Fix: Add `window.handleEditDetails = handleEditDetails;`

### API Configuration:
- Keys are in .env file
- Build script injects them during build
- Local dev runs in offline mode (expected)

### Deployment:
- GitHub push triggers automatic Cloudflare deployment
- Production URL: https://signup.distributedcreatives.org
