# TASK-004: Verify & Stabilize Creator Type Modal Data Load

## Background
A previous patch added an async wait in `openCreatorTypeModal()` so the modal should only open after `creatorTypes` are loaded (from Supabase RPC or local JSON). We must confirm this fix works and that categories render reliably.

## Objective
Ensure the creator-type modal populates with categories/subcategories every time, with or without network latency.

## Steps
1. **Prerequisite:** TASK-002 (Supabase connectivity) should be complete so RPC returns data. If not, ensure fallback `creator-types.json` still loads.
2. Build & serve:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx serve dist
   ```
3. In the browser:
   1. Open page, open devtools (Network tab), throttle to ‘Slow 3G’ to simulate latency.
   2. Click the creator-type input to open modal.
   3. Confirm categories render (no blank modal).
   4. Select a category & subcategory, click **Save Selection**, modal closes and selection appears in form.
4. Repeat with normal network speed and with offline mode (toggle devtools offline) to ensure local JSON fallback renders.

## Code Checks (optional)
- Confirm `openCreatorTypeModal()` contains:
  ```js
  if (!creatorTypes) await loadCreatorTypes();
  ```
- Confirm `loadCreatorTypes()` sets global variable then calls `loadCreatorTypesIntoModal()`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Modal opens populated on slow network, offline, and normal conditions.
- No console errors containing `creatorTypes` or `undefined`.
- Selection persists in hidden form field `#creatorTypeSelections`.

## Estimated Effort
~10–15 minutes testing; minimal code changes expected.
