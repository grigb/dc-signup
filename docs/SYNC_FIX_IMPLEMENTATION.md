# Sync Fix Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Submissions**: Multiple copies of same email (e.g., 5x testfix@example.com)
2. **Database Errors**: Error 57014 (statement timeout) when trying to insert duplicates
3. **Infinite Retry Loop**: Failed submissions stayed as 'pending' forever
4. **Incorrect Count**: UI showed 9 pending but some were already synced

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Deduplication Before Sync (lines 2073-2086)
```javascript
// Deduplicate submissions by email and timestamp
const seen = new Set()
pendingSubmissions = pendingSubmissions.filter(sub => {
    const key = `${sub.email}-${sub.created_at}`
    if (seen.has(key)) {
        console.log(`Skipping duplicate submission for ${sub.email}`)
        sub.sync_status = 'duplicate'
        updateLocalSubmission(sub)
        return false
    }
    seen.add(key)
    return true
})
```

### 2. Check Before Insert (lines 1978-1988)
```javascript
// First check if email already exists in database
const { data: existingMember, error: checkError } = await supabase
    .from('members')
    .select('email')
    .eq('email', submission.email)
    .single()

if (existingMember) {
    console.log(`Email ${submission.email} already exists in database, marking as synced`)
    return true // Consider it synced since it's already there
}
```

### 3. Handle Duplicate Key Errors (lines 2015-2019)
```javascript
if (error.code === '23505' || error.message?.includes('duplicate')) {
    console.log(`Email ${submission.email} already exists (duplicate key error), marking as synced`)
    return true // Consider it synced since it's a duplicate
}
```

### 4. Maximum Retry Limit (lines 2085-2091, 2101-2105)
```javascript
// Skip if we've already tried too many times
if (submission.attempts >= 3) {
    submission.sync_status = 'failed'
    updateLocalSubmission(submission)
    console.log(`Marking submission for ${submission.email} as permanently failed after ${submission.attempts} attempts`)
    continue
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Duplicates are removed** before sync attempts
2. **Existing emails** are marked as synced without insert
3. **Failed submissions** stop retrying after 3 attempts
4. **Offline count** only shows truly pending items
5. **No more timeout errors** from duplicate inserts

## Testing Needed

1. Verify duplicate detection works
2. Confirm failed submissions are marked after 3 attempts
3. Check that offline count updates correctly
4. Ensure no infinite retry loops
5. Test that legitimate new submissions still sync

## How It Works Now

```
1. User submits form
   → Saved locally with sync_status='pending'
   
2. Sync process starts
   → Deduplicates by email+timestamp
   → Marks duplicates as sync_status='duplicate'
   
3. For each unique submission:
   → Check if email exists in DB
   → If yes: mark as 'synced'
   → If no: try to insert
   
4. If insert fails:
   → Check if duplicate key error → mark as 'synced'
   → Otherwise increment attempts
   → After 3 attempts → mark as 'failed'
   
5. UI shows only sync_status='pending' in count
```

## Manual Cleanup

If there are still stuck submissions, use the cleanup tool at:
`/tests/manual/clear-failed-submissions.html`

Or run the Node.js script:
`node tests/manual/inspect-localstorage.js`
