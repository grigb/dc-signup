# DC Signup System – Handover 2025-07-04 07:33

## Project Status Summary
The DC Signup System has a working fix for the JavaScript error, but the fix isn't reaching users due to service worker caching issues. The core problem (renderCreatorTypes null reference) has been resolved by removing the unnecessary function call from resetForm(). However, the service worker continues to serve the old cached version, preventing the form from transitioning back after submission.

## Key Decisions (this session)
1. **Root cause identified**: The JavaScript fix is correct but blocked by service worker caching
2. **Fix verified**: In online mode with cache-busting, the form works perfectly
3. **Service worker strategy updated**: Changed from cache-first to network-first for HTML files
4. **Cache version incremented**: Updated to 'dc-genesis-v3-fixed' to force refresh
5. **Testing revealed**: Different behavior between online mode (working) and offline mode (broken due to cache)

## Priority Next Steps
1. **Complete service worker update** - Finish implementing network-first strategy for HTML files
2. **Build and deploy the updated service worker** - Ensure cache-busting mechanism works
3. **Test complete submission flow** - Verify form transitions properly after submission
4. **Add version tracking to service worker** - Include timestamp or version in cache name for future updates
5. **Document cache-busting strategy** - Add instructions for forcing updates in production
6. **Implement user notification for updates** - Show users when new version is available

## Critical Technical Notes
- **JavaScript fix applied**: Removed `renderCreatorTypes()` call from `resetForm()` function (line 1956)
- **Service worker file**: `/src/sw.js` updated with network-first strategy for HTML
- **Cache name updated**: Changed from 'dc-genesis-v1' to 'dc-genesis-v3-fixed'
- **Build process**: Must run `npm run build` to copy changes from src/ to dist/
- **Testing approach**: Use cache-busting URL parameters or incognito mode to bypass service worker
- **Production concern**: Users with cached service worker will need forced update mechanism

## Testing Results
- ✅ JavaScript error fixed (no more null reference errors)
- ✅ Form submission works in online mode with cache busting
- ❌ Form submission broken in offline mode due to cached old code
- ✅ No console errors when using updated code
- ⚠️ Service worker aggressively caches old version

## Files Modified
- `/src/index.html` - Fixed renderCreatorTypes call in resetForm()
- `/src/sw.js` - Updated cache strategy and version
- Service worker needs to be properly deployed to take effect
