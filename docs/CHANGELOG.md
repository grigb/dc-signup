## [Today] - AI Assistant
### Changed
- Modified admin.html: Added offline member cache (IndexedDB), bulk select/delete, and single confirmation modal for deletes
- Updated docs/ADMIN-TOOL-PLAN.md: Documented implementation and update mandate

## 2025-07-03 - AI Assistant
### Changed
- Fixed: Form now always auto-transitions back to the initial state after successful submission in `src/index.html`.

### Why
- The form sometimes remained on the confirmation step after submission due to incomplete UI state reset. This was a deployment blocker and a key UX issue.

### What Changed
- Made the transition logic in `submitConfirmedData` robust: confirmation step is fully hidden, form and parent containers are fully shown, and all relevant style properties are set.

### Testing
- Manually tested: Submitting the form now always returns the user to the initial form view, regardless of previous state.

### Notes
- No new files or dependencies added. All changes are minimal and follow project and CLAUDE.md rules.
