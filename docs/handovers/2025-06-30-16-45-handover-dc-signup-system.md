# DC Signup System Handover - 2025-06-30-16-45

## Project Status
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Review submission page layout is broken and needs immediate fix for tonight's deployment deadline.

## Project Context
- **Primary Goal**: Offline iPad signup system for conference booth (urgent deadline)
- **Technology**: Standalone HTML/JS with Supabase backend, PWA capabilities
- **Location**: `/Users/grig/work/distributed-creatives/websites/dc-signup-system/`

## Critical Issue Details
The confirmation step (review submission page) has severe layout problems:
1. **Buttons not visible** unless window is very tall
2. **Scrolling area condensed** to single line height 
3. **Original form's submit button visible** on confirmation screen
4. **CSS positioning broken** for the confirmation overlay

## Recent Changes Made
- Applied CSS fixes to `#confirmationStep` with absolute positioning
- Modified scrollable content height calculations
- Updated confirmation header and fixed bottom styles
- **Result**: Still broken, possibly made worse

## Key Technical Notes
- **DO NOT use Playwright tests** - user explicitly forbid this approach
- **Use Chrome browser inspection** to debug layout issues
- **Focus on CSS flexbox layout** for confirmation step
- **File to modify**: `index.html` around lines 650-690 (CSS) and 1013-1037 (HTML structure)

## CSS Structure Issues Identified
```css
#confirmationStep {
    position: absolute; /* May be causing issues */
    top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

## Priority Next Steps
1. **Browser inspect the confirmation step** in Chrome to see actual rendered layout
2. **Fix CSS positioning** - likely need to use proper container constraints
3. **Ensure scrollable content** has proper height calculations
4. **Test button visibility** at various window heights (especially mobile/iPad)
5. **Verify form flow** works end-to-end
6. **Deploy immediately** once fixed

## User Feedback
- "Please focus directly on that and nothing else"
- "It's pretty broken, whatever you just did"
- "This has to be deployed tonight"
- **Explicitly forbid Playwright testing** - use browser inspection only

## Files Modified This Session
- `index.html` - CSS fixes for confirmation step (lines 650-690, 1013-1037)

## Critical Success Criteria
- Buttons always visible regardless of window height
- Scrollable content area actually scrolls
- Clean layout without overlay issues
- Works on iPad/mobile dimensions
